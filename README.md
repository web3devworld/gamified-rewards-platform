This Gamified Rewards Platform is using React.js, Polygon, Solidity, and IPFS, and is organized into several files. Below is the complete structure of the project, along with the code for each file. This setup assumes you're using Hardhat for smart contract development, ethers.js for blockchain interactions, and Pinata for IPFS integration.

# Gamified Rewards Platform

A decentralized platform where users earn rewards for completing tasks.

## Features
- Connect wallet
- Complete tasks and earn tokens
- Claim rewards
- Prevent double task completions
- Real-time UI updates

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install Hardhat globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g hardhat
   ```

### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone the Repository:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/web3devworld/gamified-rewards-platform.git
   cd gamified-rewards-platform
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Install the required dependencies for both the smart contract and frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Compile the Smart Contract:
   Compile the Solidity smart contract using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy the Smart Contract:
   Deploy the smart contract to the Polygon Mumbai testnet:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
   ```
   - Replace `0xYourRewardTokenAddress` in `scripts/deploy.js` with the address of your ERC20 token contract.
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains the following variables:
     ```plaintext
     POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key
     PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
     REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
     ```

5. Update Frontend Configuration:
   After deploying the smart contract, copy the deployed contract address and paste it into the `.env` file under `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

6. Start the Frontend:
   Start the React frontend locally:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

7. Host the Frontend:
   Once tested locally, host the frontend on a platform like Vercel or Netlify:
   - Push your code to GitHub.
   - Connect your repository to Vercel or Netlify and deploy the `frontend` folder.

8. Test the Platform:
   - Use MetaMask to connect to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.
   - Test task completion, reward claiming, and leaderboard functionality.

## Hosting
- Push the project to GitHub.
- Host the frontend on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Use [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) for IPFS storage if needed.
